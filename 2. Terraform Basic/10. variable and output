we can create different file for output and variable like
variable.tf and output.tf
and declare variable and output in those file.

------------------
# Sensitive variable
------------------
 for Sensitive variable default value, we should use terraform.tfvars file

 and define variable in this file

 like
 file name: terraform.tfvars

----------

ext_port = 1880

----------

and remove default value of that variable
thats it.

If stored variable in another tfvars file and want to take those variable value then we should use
command:
    terraform plan/apply --var-file = central.tfvars

or we can directly value like
    terraform plan/apply -var ext_port = 1980

------------------
# Variable precedence
------------------

if we type command  terraform plan -var ext_port = 2000 --var-file=central.tfvars
    then value of ext_port = value stored in central file
    because it overwrite the value of previsouly define value


------------------
# Hide Sensitive variable from CLI
------------------

Then use Sensitive flag inside variable

variable "ext_port" {
    type = number
    sensitive = true

}

and if output include these sensitive variable then apply sensitive = true to that output as well
but you cant see these info in console or in outputs
