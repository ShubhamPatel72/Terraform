Terraform is able to import existing infrastructure. This allows you take resources 
you've created by some other means and bring it under Terraform management.

prior to running terraform import it is necessary to write manually a resource configuration block 
for the resource, to which the imported object will be mapped.

Command:
    terraform import resource id

example:
    terraform import docker_container.Nodered_cont2 $(docker inspect --format="{{.ID}})" name)

    before run this command make sure you configure resource in root file(main.tf)
