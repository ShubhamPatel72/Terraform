Tainting : force the resource to destroy and reapply
similar to reloading something

   terraform  taint random_string(resource name)

 tainting this resource effect our container resource aswell bcoz it depends on random_string resource
 for name
 so total 2* count resources will be effected by this.

command for untaint:
   terraform untaint random_string
