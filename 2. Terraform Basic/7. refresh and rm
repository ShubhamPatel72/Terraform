-------------------------------------
REFRESH COMMAND:

The terraform refresh command reads the current settings from all managed 
remote objects and updates the Terraform state to match
This won't modify your real remote objects, but it will modify the Terraform state.

command:
    terraform refresh
    terraform refresh -target=resource

1. suppose we change name of our container to nodeeee and apply refresh command.
This wont change terraform state but now in output new name is shown.

2. suppose we change length of random_string to 5 and apply refresh command.
This wont change anything bcoz this change to change length we need to apply these changes.

--------------------------------------
RM COMMAND:

Terraform will search the state for any instances matching the given resource address, and remove the 
record of each one so that Terraform will no longer be tracking the corresponding remote objects.

command:
    terraform state rm [options] ADDRESS...

1. Suppose we created 2 docker container and remove one docker container through docker rm command
But it will not reflect in terraform state so remove that container we will use
terraform state rm docker_container.Nodered_cont[1]
